Eve Online: Situation Report

The idea behind Eve Online: SitRep, is to allow in game corporations a level of reporting not found in a single application. At the time of this writing, we have to use several applications and online tools just to manage a corporation. Yet there is no easy way to see the details. 

Questions we need to answer are:
- How much is each corp member bringing in per month?
- How much does the corp earn and spend in Citadels and other structures?
- Can we intregrate Fleet-Up for fittings, fleets, timers, etc?
- Application Processing & Intel Drill-Down
- POCO and Citadel Management (fuel, timers, costs vs income on each item)
- How can we making Mining Ledgers useful in a corp enviroment
- Intel Managment - be that online parsing, reporting and Redit/Forums/google searching of key terms automaticly.
    - i.e. - Key Term "The Spire" is searched in Redit, Eve Online Forums, and Google, etc - and sorted by date to see what intel can be
      mustered about a region, etc.
